# Hashtag and URL Segmentation

Based on the [problem](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/url-hashtag-segmentation) of resolving a url link like ```www.thereisasnakeinmyboot.com``` or hashtag ```#GoAllTheWay44```
into the segmented phrases contained in them: 

  ```www.thereisasnakeinmyboot.com``` ----> ```there is a snake in my boot```
  
  ```#GoAllTheWay44``` ----> ```go all the way 44```

### Some Notes

- A custom words corpus is provided (missing the word "is" by the way...)
- Need to make it accomodate when no 'www' appears in the web address
- Need to remove the `main` call
